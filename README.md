This plugin was designed for handling basic functions inside the EarthPol Geopolitical Server (June 2021)

Now repurposed for EarthMC ;) (As of April 2024)

This version is made for 1.19.4.


Features:
 - Viable Anti-Claimhop and Anti-CombatLog plugin
 - Prevents Anti-Claimhop by keeping a player damageable even if they
   enter claims
 - Prevents the usage of Riptide, Ender Chest access and Elytras in combat
 - Configurable combat timer (30s currently)
 - Prevents the usage of a configurable set of commands (such as teleportation)
 - + other features specific to the EarthMC environment.
